#### Brief Description of your Solution - 
We are developing a social media platform. As the given scenario we were asked to develop the 
application to review the food and beverage. So, we will develop our project as ‘foodies’. The users will 
be able to create their posts with 1 to 4 photos with a description. They can view, like and comment on
the other users’ posts. They will be given access to control their post like deleting, updating their post 
and the comments they received (Deleting the comments). And also they can delete or update their own 
comments which they post in other’s posts. We will develop this app as a web application. And the 
whole project will be secured with OAuth based authentication.
